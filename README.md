Source code (I am not sure if complete) of my first and only released intro64 called Klatwa (which curse in Polish). It was collab with collegue named Unseen and Nazgul - don't have contact to this folks anymore. 

Whole thing written in assembler, compiled with Turbo Assembler with EOS library for protected mode and music.
